<h1>ClimateWins-Machine-Learning-Python</h1>

Cimate Wins is interested in using machine learning to help predict the consequences of climate change around Europe and, potentially, the world.
Their primary concern lies in the growing frequency and intensity of extreme weather events observed over the past two decades.

<h1>Objectives</h1>
ClimateWins aims to harness machine learning tools to develop a model capable of predicting weather patterns, including extreme events, across mainland Europe. By leveraging cutting-edge technology, this model has the potential to provide accurate weather forecasts globally, helping communities prepare for and mitigate the impact of severe weather conditions.

<h1>Hypothesis</h1>
• Hypothesis 1: Can Machine Learning Improve Prediction Accuracy for Extreme Weather Events?


• Hypothesis 2: Which machine learning models are most effective for forecasting extreme weather events?


• Hypothesis 3: Can Machine Learning Improve Climate Risk Assessment for Agriculture and Other Sectors?


<h1>Data & Tools</h1>

Dataset based on weather observations from 18 different weather stations across Europe.

Contains data ranging from the late 1800s to 2022.

Recordings exist for almost every day with values such as temperature, wind speed, snow, global radiation etc.

This data is collected by the <a href="https://www.ecad.eu/">European Climate Assessment & Data Set project</a>
